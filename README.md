This codebase is copyright T9 Productions, 2011. It is not currently licensed for third-parties, although the intention is to release under the Apache 2.0 license as soon as possible. As the original software contains third-party code under other licenses, the code must first be inspected carefully, to avoid potential license conflicts.

## WebCL ##
[WebCL](http://www.khronos.org/webcl/) is an emerging web standard for accessing a computer's GPU (Graphics Processor Unit) for general purpose computation. At this time there are two open-source implementations: [a Firefox 4 plugin from Nokia](http://webcl.nokiaresearch.com/), and [a Webkit prototype from Samsung](http://code.google.com/p/webcl/).

## History ##
Tumen Miner started life as [Krad Miner](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Krad_Miner), developed by [oneman](https://github.com/oneman). Its development went into hiatus on June 2011, due in part to DDoS attacks made against the core infrastructure. In December of 2011 the code was purchased by T9 Productions, with the intention of releasing it as open source.
